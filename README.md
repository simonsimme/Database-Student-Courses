# 🎓 Student Portal Database Project

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to the **Student Portal Database Project**! This project is designed to efficiently manage student information, course registrations, and academic progress within a university setting. Built using **PostgreSQL**, the database includes tables, views, and triggers to ensure **data integrity** and provide **insightful academic tracking**.

## 🚀 Features
- **📁 Student Information Management** – Store and manage student details, including ID, name, login credentials, program, and branch.
- **📚 Course Management** – Maintain course details such as course codes, names, credits, and associated departments.
- **📝 Registration System** – Handle student course registrations, including **waiting lists** for courses with limited capacity.
- **📊 Academic Progress Tracking** – Monitor student progress, completed courses, grades, and **eligibility for graduation**.
- **🔍 Views and Triggers** – Utilize SQL views and triggers to automate data processing and maintain consistency.

## 📂 Project Structure
This project is structured into several key components:

### 📌 ER Model
- The project started with an **Entity-Relationship (ER) model**, defining the database schema.
- Outlines relationships between entities such as **students, courses, and departments**.

### 🏗️ Database Schema
- **Tables**: Created based on the ER model, ensuring **data integrity** using constraints.
- **Views**: Simplifies data retrieval (e.g., `BasicInformation` view combines student details with branch data).
- **Triggers**: Automates actions like **course registrations** and **waiting list management**.

### 🖥️ Java Application
- A **Java-based application** was developed to interact with the database using **JDBC**.
- Allows users to:
  - **Register & unregister for courses** 📜
  - **Retrieve detailed student information in JSON format** 📄

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
This project provided hands-on experience in:

- **🛠️ Database Design** – Understanding **normalization** and **ER modeling**.
- **🔎 SQL Mastery** – Writing **complex queries, views, and triggers**.
- **🐘 PostgreSQL Expertise** – Leveraging advanced database management features.
- **☕ Java Development** – Using **JDBC** for seamless database interactions.
- **🛡️ Data Integrity** – Implementing **constraints and triggers** for consistency.

## 🏗️ Development Process
1. **ER Model** – Designed to define entity relationships.
2. **Database Tables** – Created with appropriate constraints.
3. **SQL Views** – Simplified data retrieval for better insights.
4. **Triggers** – Implemented automation to maintain consistency.
5. **Java Application** – Developed a user-friendly interface for database interaction.
